Water supply remains a major issue in several countries. When designing a water supply
network optimality is a priority. The aim of this project is to find optimal network
structures using automation and machine learning.
The development process is divided into several stages. During the first stage, network
topology has been studied. A network has been designed using our software on real-world
data.

\noindent Next stages will involve adding further parameters such as water velocity or 
pressure to the existing model. The project has a multidisciplinary nature. Using geographical 
data requires a certain level of acquaintance with different formats and software such as QGis. 
On the other hand, mastering a programming language like Python is required to implement the different
 algorithms and libraries.
