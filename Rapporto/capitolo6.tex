\noindent
The clustering algorithm and the MST were executed on a shapefile obtained from a map of Limitone,
near Potenza in southern Italy. The network obtained is shown in Fig??.
Several sub-networks can be distinguished. The main one is the adduction network which carries the water to
every village. The other ones are distribution networks which distribute water within every village.
This test showed that the clustering algorithm was able to identify villages from a shapefile that only
displayed the buildings of the area. In addition, it also showed that it was possible to build a MST linking
linking all the villages and buildings.
